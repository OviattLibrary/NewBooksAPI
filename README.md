# New Books API

This API makes use of Ex Libris' APIs, particularly the Alma and Primo APIs. The primary purpose is to fetch a list of new books that have been acquired by the Oviatt Library. The list of new books is typically generated in a report that the API can then fetch and manipulate. The report's list of books is usually filtered by a given time range, say new books in reading room within last 30 days. The API is used to fetch this information in a JSON format that should be easier to parse.
